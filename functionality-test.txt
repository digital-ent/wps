This is an example test I'm using as a way to yap about this project and test the onchange function if it works perfectly. It handles the trimming of the text and reading it using FileReader; among other things, there are functions that ensure the button is disabled onload to prevent sending an empty file or no inputs placed by the user.

Do note, that this project reads the individual words in the .txt file that are separated with spaces, so do keep that in mind should words be merged together as the reader have read two or more words as one. So, make sure your words are separated unless you want a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious length text to pop up. You most likely saw how that went and I'm not gonna fix that, hehe.

Among the other things that I've added is the information button which will show who developed it (me), and possibly other contributors should they choose to do. This project was created to be the basics, no reliance on frameworks and any third-parties. A testing ground of what I learned in school and a step to my beginnings as a web developer. That said, I think I've yapped for a long time now, so I'll end it here and say: Banana!
